    <td>I think that i could have done at least another 2-3% if i had been trying for the whole lesson but as i said i got distracted and i therefore did not do as much work as i could have done due to my github blog, nonetheless i do think that i had a good lesson with some harder questions.</td>

    <td>I think the two main things holding me back this lesson were me losing concentration and me not focusing on Python / codecademy that much, otherwise i am fairly happy with the outcome of this lesson in general.</td>
