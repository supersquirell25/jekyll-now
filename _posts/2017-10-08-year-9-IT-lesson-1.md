  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that i have made a fair amount of progress but i also think that i could have made much more progress had i understood what we were being taught straight away. I learned by exploring what I could do but also trying to find the simplest ways to perform the action that I was instructed to do.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It took me awhile to get used to school IT again but after that it went alright and i eventually got into it again. Otherwise Not much limited my learning as I focused on what I needed to do. Sometimes I asked my partner for help but he guided me towards finding out the answer to my problem instead of just telling me the answer to it. (Brendan Frank) </td>
