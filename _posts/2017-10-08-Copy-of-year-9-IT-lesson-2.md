    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that i have made a good amount of progress but i also think that i could have made much more progress had i been more successful in my work from the previous lesson. I did however learn by trial and error what I could do, but also trying to find the simplest ways to perform the action that I was instructed to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have done much much better if i had only done the work from the previous lesson to a higher and much better standard. Apart from that Not much limited my learning, I concentrated and focused on what I needed to do. Sometimes I asked my partner for help but he guided me towards finding out the answer to my problem instead of just telling me the answer to it. (Brendan Frank)</td>
