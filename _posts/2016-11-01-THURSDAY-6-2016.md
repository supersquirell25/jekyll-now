THURSDAY 6 OCTOBER 2016

In today's lesson we carried on further with FUZE BOXES as we will be doing for the coming weeks, in todayâ€™s lesson i had to work with a different partner and this seemed to work much better! We made it through nearly two whole sections, which is quite a lot! Also we had to make different icons appear using coding instead of making the computer just say something simple!
