    <td>How did I learn?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that i have made a good amount of progress, my work now looks much neater and only has 1 or maybe 2 weak features that i need to fix. Also i learned by exploring what I could do but also trying to find the simplest ways to perform the action that I was instructed to do.

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have done much much better if i had slightly more time to fix the two slightly buggy features in my discount prices. Also Not much limited my learning as I focused on what I needed to do. Sometimes I asked my partner for help but he guided me towards finding out the answer to my problem instead of just telling me the answer to it. (Brendan Frank)</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I could have done better had my discount prices not have bugged out at the end. And Next time I will try to finish even more and try to retain the knowledge that I have learned!</td>
