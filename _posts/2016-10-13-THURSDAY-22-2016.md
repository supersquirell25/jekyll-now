THURSDAY 22 SEPTEMBER 2016

In today's lesson we carried on with the subject of 'the FUZE boxâ€™. I personally do not enjoy this topic as I do not greatly understand it, but it could be a lot worse. Anyway we looked further into the manual, this involved making it say something along the lines of "we have 6 apples, if we eat 1 then we have 5 apples." (6x)

Until it got to 0 apples remaining! Since we made a lot more progress this week we used my USB stick to save all of the information and progress we made!
