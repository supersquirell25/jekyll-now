In today's lesson we learnt a bit more on internet security and safety but we mainly looked at sexting and revenge pornography because it is a very real threat nearing our teenage.

We also talked about certain things we may be worried about on the internet, E.g stalkers.

We also got homework to read a news article about sexting and revenge pornography and keep the URL's of the websites we looked at!
