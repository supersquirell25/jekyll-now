MORE ABOUT THE LESSON

In today's lesson we learnt about adverts and their underlying messages. The advert we watched was about hamsters starting of fat and slowly getting fitter at the gym and eventually become the most trendy hamsters to walk down the red carpet. Whilst all of that is happening they are evolving the old kia into the new kia therefore suggesting that the car evolves just like how the hamsters evolved.
