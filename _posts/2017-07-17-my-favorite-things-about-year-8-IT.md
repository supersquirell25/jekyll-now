This year in IT was, overall, very interesting and enjoyable. We learned lots of useful skills and then improved them. We spent the majority of the year improving these skills and doing a few other things, such as coding on the FUZE boxes. I worked with my group consisting of Finn Morrisroe and Benjamin Sired. We made a fair amount of progress on the FUZE box, we also coded many different codes that had different effects on LED's. We also learned how to program with Raspberry Pi.  Later on in the term we started programming a robotic arm to do actions such as grab, move and drop. Later on in the term we did different challenges et by the teacher, these were also very fun. During the next term we did drama and IT therefore I cannot talk much about IT.
