    <td>I think i made a decent amount of progress today and i beat my goal of getting through another 5% of codcademy. I finished off the date and time section and got quite far through boolean.</td>

    <td>I think that i could have done at least another 4% if i had been trying for the whole lesson but i got distracted and i therefore did not do as much work as i could have done.</td>

    <td>I think the two main things holding me back this lesson were me losing concentration and me not focusing on my computer that much, otherwise i am happy with the outcome of this lesson.</td>
