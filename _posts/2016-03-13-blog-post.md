BLOG POST

Creating the identity map was quite fun because it was a fun way to express ourselves using colours and pictures,

Sharing it with the the class was fun because we could compare each other's social lives and compare the amount of effort put in,

It felt more fair and it also saved the teacher aka mr keen a lot of time commenting on them,

I enjoyed this process more,

No it all seemed fair enough, luckily most of mine were positive,

This type of commenting is a lot more personal and we actually know the age and other details about the person marking/commenting,

Yes because I put some of the coolest moments of my life on that map whereas online I would be to worried to do that,

No not at all,

Yes these lessons did change my view on social media because now I realise how much better you could make social if you just have fun and put less stupid embarrassing thing up,

Yes I intend to use it to share my great experiences instead of stupid selfies,
