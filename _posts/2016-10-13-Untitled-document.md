During todays lesson we looked at FUZE boxes some more, we got further through the instructions more this time though because we actually understood how to get the box working! Well that was for our group anyway. We also got it to say different things or to be correct PRINT things onto the screen and then wait for 1 second eg (1) and then repeat.
