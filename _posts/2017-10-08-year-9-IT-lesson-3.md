    <td>I want to get to know some of the more advanced features of spreadsheets.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that i have made a good amount of progress but i also think that i could have made much more progress had i been more successful in my discount prices. I also learned by exploring what I could do but also trying to find the simplest ways to perform the action that I was instructed to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have done much much better if i had only done parts of my spreadsheets neater. Otherwise Not much limited my learning as I focused on what I needed to do. Sometimes I asked my partner for help but he guided me towards finding out the answer to my problem instead of just telling me the answer to it. (Brendan Frank)

    <td>The only thing really holding me back that lesson was the fact that some parts of my spreadsheets did not work fully. On the other hand there were some parts that i was quite proud of, like my vLookup.</td>
