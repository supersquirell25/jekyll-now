    <td>I think that i could have made at least another few improvements if i had been trying for the whole lesson but as i said i got distracted and i therefore did not do as much work as i could have done due to my github blog, nonetheless i do think that i had a good lesson. Also at the start of the lesson my computer bugged out a little bit. </td>
