Before our lesson today we had to hand in all our tutorials that we did on microbit. When it came to our lesson some of us did not have a good time, because they did not do their homework! I have some tips that would help these people; Don't leave your homework until the last minute, make sure you know what you are doing and if you aren't, ask a friend to help you. After this long tedious moment of people saying why they didn't do their homework we continued with our microbit game. I am working on a game called blockers
