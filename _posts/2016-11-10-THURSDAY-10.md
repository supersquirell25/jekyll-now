THURSDAY 10 NOVEMBER 2016

During today's lesson we looked at other people’s blogs! Mine was luckily not shown, but other people, like Ethan R’s were shown!  They were quite good from the looks of things. 

	I definitely think there are many ways i could improve my one by adding more details to my blogs and also using my initiative more often and making my blog a bit more "me" also i am going to try to improve my background and maybe my colour scheme!
