    <td>Even with the confusion at the start and me having to switch partner we still had a good fun lesson and i think that this lesson we learnt through comedy and we took the route a very different direction to usual, yes we did do a tiny bit less work but at least we had more fun!!</td>

    <td>I think that, although it was a very fun lesson we could have done a bit more work and maybe even reached a further stage!! But over all i am quite happy with the final outcome of the lesson</td>

    <td>Next leeson me and my partner intend to do a bit more work in trade for a bit less fun.
If we do this task well we may even do three!! Yes THREE!! Stages next lesson, and that would be fantastic!
